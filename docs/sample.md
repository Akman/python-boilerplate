# Python boilerplate project documentation

A boilerplate project that exists as an aid to the [Python Packaging User
Guide][packaging guide]'s [Tutorial on Packaging and Distributing
Projects][distribution tutorial].

This project aims to cover best practices for Python project
development as a whole. It provides tool recommendations for linting and
testing.

[The source for this project is available here][src].

Most of the configuration for project is done in the `setup.py` file.
You should edit this file accordingly to adapt this boilerplate project
to your needs.

----

This is the documentation for the project.

The file should use UTF-8 encoding and can be written using [markdown][md use]
with the appropriate [key set][md use]. It will be used to generate the project
webpage on PyPI and will be displayed as the project homepage on common
code-hosting services, and should be written for that purpose.
